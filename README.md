# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This repository contains the report for the bachelor's thesis titled "Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests." The aim of this study was to apply decision trees and random forests in predicting heart diseases.

## Introduction

Heart diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in preventing and managing these conditions. Machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and random forests, have shown promise in predicting heart diseases based on various risk factors. This study explores the use of these models and investigates their performance and effectiveness.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files the detailed report summarizing the research methodology, experimental results, and conclusions.

## Methodology

The study involved building decision tree and random forest models using the provided dataset. The models were trained and evaluated, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve their performance. Various metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, were used to assess the models' quality. Additionally, the most influential features for heart diseases were identified.

## Results and Conclusion

The decision tree model achieved better performance metrics and shorter compilation time compared to the random forest model. The best decision tree model had a depth of 8 and a maximum of 10 attributes, with an accuracy of 76.54%, sensitivity of 82.48%, and precision of 73.71%. The random forest model achieved an accuracy of 76.32%, sensitivity of 80.39%, and precision of 73.89%. The age of the respondents, overall health, presence of diabetes, and difficulty in walking were found to be the most influential factors in determining heart disease.

The limitations of the study included potential biases in the data due to self-reporting and subjective nature of certain variables. Further research can explore additional techniques, such as post-pruning, and compare different machine learning models like neural networks and logistic regression.

## Recommendations

Based on the study's findings, several preventive recommendations for heart diseases can be made. Regular cardiac consultations are advised for older individuals due to the increased risk associated with age. If shortness of breath is experienced while walking, consultation with a physician is recommended, as it is an important symptom of heart disease. To avoid diabetes and reduce the risk of heart diseases, it is advisable to limit the consumption of sugary foods, monitor fasting blood sugar levels regularly, and attend regular follow-up visits with a cardiologist. Factors such as alcohol consumption and the presence of asthma were found to have minimal impact on the development of heart diseases.
